As per project submission instructions:

- Truffle version: 5.5.1
- OpenZeppelin version: 2.3
- ERC-721 Token Name and Symbol: "StarsForStars", "STARZ" - these values are assigned in the deploy_contracts.js file
- “Token Address” on the Rinkeby Network: 0x46B74Bf3d32a67C2Cb63ecEC590aDd07d0f11C06

note: I added an extra bloc on the frontend to trigger the transferStar function.
